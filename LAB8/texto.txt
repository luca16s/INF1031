[excerpt from] Sacha Baron Cohen's Keynote Address at ADL's 2019 Never Is Now Summit on Anti-Semitism and Hate


Thatâ€™s why I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you. Today around the world, demagogues appeal to our worst instincts.  Conspiracy theories once confined to the fringe are going mainstream. Itâ€™s as if the Age of Reasonâ€”the era of evidential argumentâ€”is ending, and now knowledge is delegitimized and scientific consensus is dismissed. Democracy, which depends on shared truths, is in retreat, and autocracy, which depends on shared lies, is on the march. Hate crimes are surging, as are murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities.

What do all these dangerous trends have in common? Iâ€™m just a comedian and an actor, not a scholar. But one thing is pretty clear to me. All this hate and violence is being facilitated by a handful of internet companies that amount to the greatest propaganda machine in history.

The greatest propaganda machine in history.

Think about it. Facebook, YouTube and Google, Twitter and others â€” they reach billions of people. The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engagedâ€”stories that appeal to our baser instincts and that trigger outrage and fear. Itâ€™s why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times. Itâ€™s why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth. And itâ€™s no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history â€” the lie that Jews are somehow dangerous. As one headline put it, â€œJust Think What Goebbels Could Have Done with Facebook.â€
